## Critical Bugs Discovered and Fixed

### Bug #1: ErrorBoundary Timeout False Positives

**Severity**: 🔴 HIGH
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**
**Discovery Date**: 2025-10-10

**Symptom**:
```
[MicroAppContainer] Micro-app loading timeout: cluster-app
[ErrorBoundary] Loading timeout detected
```
Error appeared even when micro-apps loaded successfully.

**Root Cause**:
Timeout timer was started in `onMounted` but never cleared when micro-apps successfully loaded. The component was not listening to Wujie's `@afterMount` event.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `@beforeLoad`, `@afterMount`, `@loadError` event handlers to `<WujieVue>` component
- `handleAfterMount()` calls `clearLoadTimeout()` on successful load
- Removed problematic `onMounted` timeout initialization

**Files Modified**:
- `main-app/src/views/MicroAppContainer.vue` (lines 9-20, 191-200)

**Verification**:
- ✅ No timeout errors when micro-apps load successfully
- ✅ Timeout error shows only for genuine load failures
- ✅ Timeout cleared on component deactivation

**Documentation**: `BUGFIX_TIMEOUT_FALSE_POSITIVE.md`

### Bug #2: Wujie Console Error Pollution

**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**
**Discovery Date**: 2025-10-10

**Symptom**:
```
Uncaught Error: 此报错可以忽略,iframe主动中断主应用代码在子应用运行
utils.ts:377 Uncaught Error
```

**Root Cause**:
Wujie framework intentionally throws errors from iframes to isolate execution contexts. These are benign but pollute the console.

**Fix Applied**:
Comprehensive error suppression in `main-app/index.html`:
1. Override `console.error` to filter Wujie patterns
2. Override `window.onerror` to filter errors
3. Add capture-phase event listener for highest priority interception
4. Filter patterns:
   - "此报错可以忽略"
   - "iframe主动中断"
   - "stopMainAppRun"
   - Empty errors from utils.ts

**Files Modified**:
- `main-app/index.html` (lines 9-84)

**Verification**:
- ✅ Wujie benign errors no longer appear in console
- ✅ Real errors still logged normally
- ✅ No impact on error monitoring

**Documentation**: `WUJIE_CONSOLE_ERRORS.md`

### Bug #3: Route Synchronization Failure - All Pages Show Same Data

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**
**Discovery Date**: 2025-10-10

**Symptom**:
All three pages (用户管理, 角色管理, 权限管理) displayed user data. Route synchronization completely broken.

**Root Cause**:
`VbenMainLayout.vue` was using `:key="route.fullPath"` on the router-view component, causing the MicroAppContainer to be destroyed and recreated on every route change. This cleared RouteSync event listeners, breaking route synchronization.

**Problem Chain**:
1. User navigates from `/system/users` (key: "/system/users") to `/system/roles` (key: "/system/roles")
2. Different keys → Vue destroys old component and creates new one
3. Component destruction → `onUnmounted` hook fires → RouteSync teardown
4. New component mounts but route watcher doesn't trigger (route already changed)
5. Micro-app never receives route change event → stays on old route

**Fix Applied**:
Changed component key strategy in `VbenMainLayout.vue`:

```vue
<!-- BEFORE (BROKEN) -->
<component :is="Component" v-if="Component" :key="route.fullPath" />

<!-- AFTER (FIXED) -->
<component :is="Component" v-if="Component" :key="route.meta.microApp || route.name" />
```

**Why This Works**:
- `/system/users` → key = "system-app"
- `/system/roles` → key = "system-app"
- **Same key → component reused → RouteSync listeners persist → route sync works!**

**Files Modified**:
- `main-app/src/layouts/VbenMainLayout.vue` (line 21)
- `main-app/.env.development` (enabled `VITE_FEATURE_STANDARD_ROUTE_SYNC=true`)
- `system-app/.env.development` (enabled `VITE_FEATURE_STANDARD_ROUTE_SYNC=true`)

**Verification**:
- ✅ Navigating 用户管理 → 角色管理 → 权限管理 shows correct data
- ✅ MicroAppContainer no longer unmounts on same-app route changes
- ✅ Route watcher triggers correctly
- ✅ RouteSync events emit properly

**Console Output After Fix**:
```
[MicroAppContainer] Route watcher triggered
[MicroAppContainer] Old path: /system/users
[MicroAppContainer] New path: /system/roles
[RouteSync] Notifying micro-app: system-app, route: /roles
```
