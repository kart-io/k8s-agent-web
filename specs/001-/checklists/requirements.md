# Specification Quality Checklist: Architecture Analysis and Optimization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - ✅ PASSED

- Specification focuses on WHAT (analysis capabilities) and WHY (improve system reliability)
- Written from development team perspective without technical implementation details
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- No mention of specific tools, libraries, or programming patterns

### Requirement Completeness - ✅ PASSED

- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 12 functional requirements are testable (e.g., "MUST analyze all routing configurations")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (90% issue detection, 60% time reduction, <5 min analysis time)
- All criteria are measurable without implementation knowledge
- 3 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios (Given-When-Then format)
- 5 edge cases identified covering various failure scenarios
- Assumptions section clearly defines scope boundaries
- Dependencies on Constitution principles explicitly stated

### Feature Readiness - ✅ PASSED

- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios (FR-001 through FR-007 → US1, FR-008 → US2, FR-012 → US3)
- User stories cover complete workflow: identify issues → get recommendations → plan implementation
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific analysis tools or frameworks)
- Specification maintains abstraction layer appropriate for business stakeholders

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if refinement needed) or `/speckit.plan` (to proceed with implementation planning).

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1: identify, P2: optimize, P3: roadmap)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Well-defined measurable outcomes with specific metrics
- Proper separation of concerns (no implementation leakage)

**Ready for next phase**: ✅ YES
