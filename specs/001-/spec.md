## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Architecture Health Check Report (Priority: P1)

Development teams need to identify potential architectural issues in the K8s Agent Web micro-frontend application to prevent production incidents and improve system reliability.

**Why this priority**: Critical for understanding current system health and preventing future issues. Addresses immediate risk assessment needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by manually triggering analysis from the dashboard interface and verifying that a comprehensive report is generated covering all architecture layers (routing, state management, micro-app integration, shared components).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current K8s Agent Web codebase, **When** architecture analysis is executed, **Then** a report is generated identifying all potential issues including routing conflicts, state management problems, micro-app configuration errors, and shared component inconsistencies
2. **Given** the analysis report, **When** development team reviews it, **Then** each identified issue includes severity level (critical/high/medium/low), affected components, and potential impact description
3. **Given** an architecture with no issues, **When** analysis is executed, **Then** the report confirms all checks passed with green status

---

### User Story 2 - Optimization Recommendations (Priority: P2)

Development teams need actionable optimization recommendations to improve application performance, maintainability, and developer experience.

**Why this priority**: Builds on P1 findings to provide concrete improvement paths. Valuable but depends on understanding current issues first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by verifying that each recommendation includes measurable improvement metrics (e.g., "reduce load time by 30%"), implementation complexity assessment, and priority ranking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** identified architecture issues, **When** optimization recommendations are generated, **Then** each recommendation includes expected performance improvement, effort estimation, and implementation priority
2. **Given** performance bottlenecks identified, **When** reviewing recommendations, **Then** specific optimizations for micro-app loading, bundle size, and runtime performance are provided with quantified benefits
3. **Given** maintainability concerns, **When** reviewing recommendations, **Then** code structure improvements and pattern standardizations are suggested with rationale

---

### User Story 3 - Implementation Roadmap (Priority: P3)

Development teams need a prioritized implementation roadmap to systematically apply optimizations without disrupting ongoing development.

**Why this priority**: Provides long-term planning guidance. Useful but not immediately critical compared to identifying and understanding issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying the roadmap includes phased implementation plan, dependency tracking between optimizations, and risk assessment for each phase.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** all optimization recommendations, **When** implementation roadmap is created, **Then** optimizations are grouped into phases (quick wins, short-term, long-term) with clear dependencies
2. **Given** the roadmap, **When** team reviews each phase, **Then** estimated timeline, required resources, and rollback strategies are documented
3. **Given** multiple optimizations affecting the same component, **When** sequencing is determined, **Then** potential conflicts are identified and resolution order is specified

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when analysis is run on a system that has custom modifications not following documented patterns?
- How does the system handle scenarios where micro-apps are partially migrated or in inconsistent states?
- What happens when optimization recommendations conflict with each other or with existing business requirements?
- How does analysis handle environments where some micro-apps are unavailable or not responding?
- What happens when shared components have breaking changes affecting multiple micro-apps simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze all routing configurations (static and dynamic) to identify conflicts, missing route guards, and improper wildcard usage
- **FR-002**: System MUST examine micro-app registration and configuration in wujie-config.js to verify proper CORS settings, lifecycle configuration, and URL correctness
- **FR-003**: System MUST evaluate state management implementation to identify issues with Pinia store usage, state persistence, and cross-app communication patterns
- **FR-004**: System MUST review shared component library structure to detect duplicated code, improper exports, and inconsistent import patterns
- **FR-005**: System MUST assess micro-app independence by verifying each app can run standalone and has proper isolation
- **FR-006**: System MUST analyze bundle sizes and loading performance to identify optimization opportunities
- **FR-007**: System MUST check adherence to Constitution principles (Micro-Frontend Isolation, Wujie-First Architecture, Standard Vue 3 Simplicity, etc.)
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate prioritized recommendations with measurable success criteria for each optimization
- **FR-009**: System MUST identify security vulnerabilities including exposed credentials, insecure communication patterns, and improper authentication handling
- **FR-010**: System MUST evaluate error handling patterns across all applications to ensure consistent user experience
- **FR-011**: System MUST assess documentation completeness and accuracy against actual implementation
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide implementation roadmap grouping optimizations by complexity, impact, and dependencies
- **FR-013**: System MUST present analysis results through an interactive web dashboard allowing users to filter by severity, affected components, and issue categories with drill-down capability for detailed findings
- **FR-014**: System MUST persist historical analysis results with timestamps to enable before/after comparisons and trend analysis showing issue resolution progress over time
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide automated remediation for safe, low-risk issues (e.g., formatting, simple configuration fixes) requiring explicit user approval before applying any code changes
- **FR-016**: System MUST classify each issue as auto-fixable or manual-only based on risk assessment and complexity, clearly indicating which issues support automated remediation
- **FR-017**: System MUST support manual on-demand analysis execution triggered by users through the dashboard interface without requiring CI/CD pipeline integration or automated scheduling
- **FR-018**: System MUST classify issue severity based on production impact and risk: Critical (causes system failure/data loss), High (degrades core functionality), Medium (affects non-critical features), Low (code quality/maintainability concerns)

### Key Entities

- **Architecture Issue**: Represents a detected problem with severity level determined by production impact (Critical: system failure/data loss; High: core functionality degradation; Medium: non-critical feature issues; Low: code quality concerns), affected components, description, potential impact, remediation guidance, and auto-fix classification (auto-fixable/manual-only with risk assessment)
- **Optimization Recommendation**: Represents a suggested improvement with expected benefit metrics, implementation complexity (low/medium/high), effort estimation, priority ranking, and implementation steps
- **Component Health Status**: Represents the health state of each architecture layer (routing/state/micro-apps/shared/build) with pass/fail checks and detailed findings
- **Implementation Phase**: Represents a grouping of related optimizations with timeline estimation, resource requirements, dependencies, and risk assessment
- **Analysis Dashboard**: Interactive web interface presenting analysis results with filtering capabilities (by severity, component, category), drill-down views for detailed findings, and navigation between related issues and recommendations
- **Analysis History Record**: Time-stamped snapshot of analysis results including all detected issues, recommendations, and health status at a specific point in time, enabling before/after comparisons and trend visualization
- **Automated Fix**: Represents a safe, auto-applicable code change for a detected issue, including the proposed change preview, affected files, risk level, and requiring explicit user approval before execution
