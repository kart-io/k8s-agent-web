## Known Issues & Limitations

### None - All Critical Issues Resolved

All blockers from previous architecture have been addressed:

- ✅ **Fixed**: Blank pages on direct navigation (RouteSync class)
- ✅ **Fixed**: Configuration scattered across multiple files (centralized config)
- ✅ **Fixed**: No error handling (ErrorBoundary component)
- ✅ **Fixed**: Slow shared library builds (pre-built ESM)
- ✅ **Fixed**: No cross-app state sync (SharedStateManager)

### Minor Enhancements for Future Consideration

1. **JSDoc Completion** (T095): Public APIs would benefit from comprehensive JSDoc
2. **Performance Dashboard** (T098): Real-time metrics visualization
3. **Demo Video** (T100): Visual demonstration for stakeholder presentations

**Impact**: Low priority, non-blocking for production deployment

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Breaking down into 5 user stories enabled independent testing
2. **Test-Driven Approach**: Writing tests first caught integration issues early
3. **Documentation First**: Clear specifications (spec.md, plan.md) streamlined implementation
4. **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes accelerated adoption
5. **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout capability provides safety net

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Build Configuration**: Vite library mode required careful peer dependency externalization
2. **Route Sync Timing**: Debounce mechanism needed to prevent event storms
3. **State Namespace Design**: Careful consideration of isolation vs sharing
4. **Error Boundary Scope**: Determining appropriate granularity for error catching

### Best Practices Established

1. **Configuration as Code**: Single source of truth pattern
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Standardized protocols for inter-app communication
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Error boundaries prevent catastrophic failures
4. **Build Optimization**: Pre-built libraries significantly improve developer experience
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit + E2E coverage ensures reliability

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Optional)

1. **Code Review**: Review Phase 7-8 changes with team
2. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging environment
3. **Metrics Baseline**: Collect performance metrics (T097)

### Short-Term (1-2 weeks)

1. **Complete Polish Tasks**: T094-T095 (code documentation)
2. **Team Training**: Conduct knowledge transfer sessions
3. **Production Deployment**: Gradual rollout via feature flags

### Long-Term (1-3 months)

1. **Monitor Performance**: Track metrics over time
2. **Gather Feedback**: Collect developer and user feedback
3. **Iterate**: Continuous improvement based on real-world usage
