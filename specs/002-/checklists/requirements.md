# Specification Quality Checklist: 微前端架构优化

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Details

1. **Content Quality**:
   - Specification focuses on "what" and "why", not "how"
   - Written from user/developer perspective (开发工程师, 前端架构师, 产品经理, 运维工程师)
   - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
   - Only high-level technology mentions in Assumptions/Dependencies sections (appropriate)

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are well-defined
   - 25 functional requirements are specific and testable (FR-001 to FR-025)
   - 8 success criteria are measurable with quantifiable metrics (time, percentage, reduction)
   - All user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format
   - 7 edge cases identified with clear handling strategies
   - Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section listing 7 excluded items

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement corresponds to user stories and acceptance scenarios
   - 5 prioritized user stories (P1, P1, P2, P2, P3) provide independent testing paths
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic:
     - ✅ "页面在500毫秒内完成渲染" (performance metric, not implementation)
     - ✅ "配置修改点从当前的3-5处减少到1处" (user outcome, not code structure)
     - ✅ "构建时间相比使用源码减少30%以上" (measurable benefit, not tool-specific)
   - No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

- The specification assumes existing Wujie framework and Vue Router, which is documented in Assumptions section appropriately
- Success criteria include both quantitative (time, percentage) and qualitative (user experience) measures
- Edge cases cover critical failure scenarios that could impact production stability
- The feature is ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (if needed) or `/speckit.plan` directly
