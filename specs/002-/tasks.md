# Tasks: ÂæÆÂâçÁ´ØÊû∂ÊûÑ‰ºòÂåñ

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included as this is an architectural improvement requiring validation at each step.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: Main app (`main-app/src/`), Micro-apps (`{app}-app/src/`), Shared (`shared/src/`)
- All paths are relative to repository root: `/home/hellotalk/code/web/k8s-agent-web/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Config) and US2 (Routes) should complete first (both P1)
  - US3 (State) and US4 (Errors) can start in parallel after US1/US2 (both P2)
  - US5 (Build) can start independently after Foundational (P3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories - Can run parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Optionally uses US1 config - Independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Wraps US1/US2 components - Independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Completely independent - Can run parallel with all others

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Utilities/classes before usage sites
- Main app changes before micro-app updates
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (T001-T005)**: All 5 tasks can run in parallel

**Foundational Phase (T006-T010)**:
- T007, T008, T009 can run in parallel (different files)
- T006, T010 sequential (T010 needs T006 schema)

**User Story 1 (T011-T021)**:
- Tests T011-T013 can all run in parallel
- Implementation: T014-T016 sequential (same file), T017-T018 can run in parallel after T014-T016

**User Story 2 (T022-T039)**:
- Tests T022-T025 can all run in parallel
- Implementation: T026-T029 sequential (same class), T030-T031 sequential (same file), T032-T037 all 6 micro-app updates can run in parallel

**User Story 3 (T040-T057)**:
- Tests T040-T043 can run in parallel
- Implementation: T044-T051 sequential (main-app), T052-T055 can run in parallel (shared), T056-T057 sequential after T044

**User Story 4 (T058-T073)**:
- Tests T058-T061 can run in parallel
- Implementation: T062-T066 sequential (same component), T067-T069 sequential (same utility), T070-T073 sequential (MicroAppContainer updates)

**User Story 5 (T074-T089)**:
- Tests T074-T076 can run in parallel
- Implementation: T077-T085 sequential (vite.config.js), T086-T089 sequential (build and verification)

**Polish Phase (T090-T100)**:
- T090-T095 documentation tasks can all run in parallel
- T096-T100 sequential (need full implementation)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Configuration)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for getMicroAppUrl() in main-app/src/config/__tests__/micro-apps.config.test.js"
Task: "Unit test for getMicroAppConfig() validation in main-app/src/config/__tests__/micro-apps.config.test.js"
Task: "E2E test for config-driven URL resolution in tests/e2e/config.spec.js"

# After tests fail, implement helpers in parallel:
Task: "Implement getMicroAppUrl(appName, env) helper function"
Task: "Implement getMicroAppConfig(appName) helper function"

# Then update usage sites in parallel:
Task: "Update main-app/src/micro/wujie-config.js to use getMicroAppUrl()"
Task: "Update main-app/src/views/MicroAppContainer.vue to use getMicroAppUrl()"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Route Sync)

```bash
# After route-sync.js class is implemented, update all 6 micro-apps in parallel:
Task: "Update system-app/src/main.js to use RouteSync.setupListener()"
Task: "Update dashboard-app/src/main.js to use RouteSync.setupListener()"
Task: "Update agent-app/src/main.js to use RouteSync.setupListener()"
Task: "Update cluster-app/src/main.js to use RouteSync.setupListener()"
Task: "Update monitor-app/src/main.js to use RouteSync.setupListener()"
Task: "Update image-build-app/src/main.js to use RouteSync.setupListener()"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only - Both P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T010) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Configuration (T011-T021)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Route Sync (T022-T039)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test config changes and route navigation independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready - **Architecture stabilized, 90% of issues resolved**

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation**: Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Infrastructure ready
2. **MVP (Week 1-2)**: Add US1 + US2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (Config + Routes stable!)
3. **Enhanced (Week 3)**: Add US3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (Cross-app state sync)
4. **Robust (Week 4)**: Add US4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (Error handling)
5. **Optimized (Week 5)**: Add US5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (Fast builds)
6. **Polished (Week 5)**: Complete Phase 8 ‚Üí Documentation and metrics

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (recommended):

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (Day 1-2)
2. **Once Foundational is done** (Day 3 onwards):
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Configuration) - T011-T021
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Route Sync) - T022-T039
   - **Developer C**: User Story 5 (Build Optimization) - T074-T089 (Independent!)
3. **After US1+US2 complete** (Week 2):
   - **Developer A**: User Story 3 (State Management) - T040-T057
   - **Developer B**: User Story 4 (Error Boundaries) - T058-T073
4. **Final week**: All developers on Phase 8 Polish

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **Verify tests fail before implementing** (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group (T001-T005, T011-T013, etc.)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Feature flags** enable gradual rollout: Test in dev, then staging, then production
- **Backward compatibility** maintained throughout: Old code continues working during migration

## Success Metrics (Target vs. Actual)

Track these after each user story completion:

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Configuration modification points | 1 (from 3-5) | ___ |
| Deep route render time | < 500ms | ___ms |
| Route sync code complexity reduction | 60%+ | ___%  |
| Cross-app state update latency | < 1s | ___ms |
| Error display time on failure | < 3s | ___s |
| Micro-app build time reduction | 30%+ | ___% |
| New micro-app integration time | < 30min (from 2h) | ___min |

---

**Total Tasks**: 100
**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 weeks (1 developer) or 2-3 weeks (2-3 developers parallel)
**MVP Scope**: User Stories 1 & 2 (T001-T039) - ~40% of tasks, delivers 80% of value
