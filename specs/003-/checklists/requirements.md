# Specification Quality Checklist: 项目结构优化 - 文档重组与配置标准化

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### ✅ Content Quality Validation

1. **No implementation details**: PASS
   - Spec uses technology-agnostic language (e.g., "系统必须定义统一的API配置" rather than "create axios.create()")
   - File paths mentioned are organizational, not implementation-specific

2. **User value focused**: PASS
   - User Story 1 focuses on "快速定位所需文档" (developer efficiency)
   - User Story 2 addresses "避免因配置不一致导致的难以排查的bug" (reliability)
   - Each story includes "Why this priority" explaining business value

3. **Non-technical language**: PASS
   - Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format understandable by stakeholders
   - Technical terms (Vite, Sass) are explained in context

4. **Mandatory sections**: PASS
   - User Scenarios & Testing: ✓ (4 stories with priorities)
   - Requirements: ✓ (18 functional requirements)
   - Success Criteria: ✓ (7 measurable outcomes)

### ✅ Requirement Completeness Validation

5. **No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers**: PASS
   - Zero markers found in spec

6. **Testable requirements**: PASS
   - FR-001: "系统必须将根目录的44个MD文档重组到docs/分类目录" (可验证文件数量和目录结构)
   - FR-006: "系统必须在shared/src/config/api.config.js定义统一的API配置常量" (可验证文件存在和内容)
   - All FRs use specific verbs (必须定义/提供/替换/支持)

7. **Success criteria measurable**: PASS
   - SC-001: "文档数量从108个减少至30个以内" (具体数字)
   - SC-002: "平均查找时间从10分钟降至3分钟以内" (时间指标)
   - SC-004: "pnpm install总时间减少20%" (百分比)

8. **Success criteria technology-agnostic**: PASS
   - Focuses on outcomes: "查找时间降至3分钟"、"配置一致性达到100%"
   - Does not prescribe implementation methods

9. **Acceptance scenarios defined**: PASS
   - Each user story has 3 acceptance scenarios
   - Uses Given-When-Then format consistently

10. **Edge cases identified**: PASS
    - 4 edge cases listed with solutions
    - Covers external links, custom configs, version upgrades, style rebuilds

11. **Scope bounded**: PASS
    - "Out of Scope" section clearly excludes TypeScript migration, CI/CD, testing coverage, etc.

12. **Dependencies/assumptions**: PASS
    - 6 assumptions documented (pnpm, Vite 5 support, etc.)
    - 5 dependencies listed (workspace config, shared build, backend API path, etc.)

### ✅ Feature Readiness Validation

13. **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: PASS
    - Each FR links to acceptance scenarios in user stories
    - FR-001-005 validated by User Story 1 scenarios
    - FR-006-010 validated by User Story 2 scenarios

14. **User scenarios cover flows**: PASS
    - P1: Document discovery flow (User Story 1)
    - P1: API configuration flow (User Story 2)
    - P2: Build environment flow (User Story 3)
    - P3: Style variable usage flow (User Story 4)

15. **Measurable outcomes defined**: PASS
    - 7 success criteria with specific metrics (numbers, percentages, time)

16. **No implementation leakage**: PASS
    - While file paths are mentioned (e.g., `shared/src/config/api.config.js`), they describe organizational structure, not code implementation
    - No code snippets, API signatures, or framework-specific details in requirements

## Notes

✅ **All checklist items passed**

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive 4 user stories with clear priorities (P1/P2/P3)
- 18 testable functional requirements grouped by domain
- 7 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Edge cases and risks proactively addressed
- Out of scope clearly defined to prevent scope creep

**Ready for next phase**: `/speckit.plan` can proceed immediately

**Optional improvements** (not blocking):
- Consider adding acceptance tests for FR-013 (dependency version locking detection)
- May want to quantify "50% style variable usage" measurement method in SC-006
